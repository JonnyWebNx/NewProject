Project Overview
Objective:
Create an interactive, AI-driven coding challenge platform that generates a new code puzzle every day. Users will solve the puzzle using the Monaco Editor, submit their solution for evaluation via the Judge0 API, receive feedback (including AI-generated explanations for errors), and track their progress through personal metrics and a global leaderboard.

Key Components
Daily Puzzle Generation:

Automated Generation:

Use a scheduled task (e.g., with node-cron) to generate a new coding puzzle every day.

Leverage an AI API (like OpenAI’s GPT) to generate the problem statement, correct solution, and a set of test cases.

Storage:

Save each daily puzzle with its test cases and solution for future reference.

User Code Submission and Evaluation:

Monaco Editor Integration:

Users write their code in the Monaco Editor.

Code is extracted programmatically using the editor’s API (e.g., editor.getValue()).

Submission Process:

User-submitted code is sent to the Judge0 API.

The API runs the code against predefined test cases.

Judge0 returns a JSON response with:

Output: Execution results.

Error Messages: Compilation or runtime errors.

Execution Details: Status, time, and memory metrics.

Feedback Mechanism:

If the solution passes all tests, a "proof" of completion is returned.

If there are errors, forward the error messages to ChatGPT to generate an explanation of what went wrong.

Allow users to edit and resubmit their solution based on the feedback.

User Data and Progress Tracking:

Daily Challenge Metrics:

Track the number of consecutive days a user successfully completes the daily challenge.

Store relevant data from each challenge (e.g., submission code, time taken, errors encountered, final output).

Learning Data:

Maintain a record of challenges solved, including feedback and performance metrics, to enable users to review their progress over time.

Leaderboard:

Metrics for Ranking:

Fastest completion time for challenges.

Highest consecutive streak of days with successful challenge completions.

Display:

A leaderboard page to showcase top performers based on these metrics.

Workflow Recap
Daily Routine:

At a scheduled time, generate a new coding puzzle with test cases and save it.

Display the daily challenge on the user interface.

User Interaction:

User writes and formats their code using the Monaco Editor.

The application extracts the code and sends it to Judge0 along with the required test cases.

Judge0 executes the code and returns results.

Based on the results:

If correct, the user receives a confirmation and proof of completion.

If incorrect, error details are sent to ChatGPT to provide a clear explanation.

The user can then modify their solution and resubmit as needed.

Progress and Leaderboard:

Store each submission and track daily completion metrics.

Update the leaderboard with statistics such as fastest completion time and longest consecutive streak.

Technical Considerations
Security:
Ensure safe code execution using sandboxed environments (Judge0) and proper validation to prevent malicious code from affecting the system.

Scalability:
For low traffic, the current setup is sufficient, but the design should allow for future scalability (e.g., self-hosting Judge0 if needed).

Data Persistence:
Choose a reliable database to store user data, daily puzzles, and submission history. Consider using an ORM for easier data management.

API Integrations:

Judge0 API: For code execution and result feedback.

ChatGPT API: For error explanation and additional feedback.

Frontend/Backend Communication:
Use RESTful endpoints or GraphQL to facilitate communication between the Vue.js frontend and the Node.js backend.
